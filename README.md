# Multi-Species Analysis of Neuronal nAChRs and Their Affinity to Venom Toxins and Ligands
Î±4Î²2 and Î±7 nAChRs

## ðŸ“„ About the Project

This repository contains the data, methods, models, and results for the study:
**"A Multi-Species Analysis of Structural and Functional Variations in Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors and Their Affinity Towards Venom Toxins and Pharmacological Ligands"**.

The study investigates the structural features and binding affinities of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly **Î±7** and **(Î±4)â‚‚(Î²2)â‚ƒ** subtypes, across 10 species. It analyzes their interaction with **snake venom 3FTX toxins** and **pharmacological ligands** using molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and pathway analyses.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

- Structural comparison of Î±7 and (Î±4)â‚‚(Î²2)â‚ƒ nAChRs in humans, mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys, pigs, dogs, cattle, goats, and sheep.
- Binding studies of nAChRs with:
  - Snake venom-derived **three-finger toxins (3FTX)**.
  - Known **agonists and antagonists** from PubChem.
- Evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis.
- Ligand-receptor interaction modeling using **AutoDock4**, **HADDOCK**, and **GROMACS**.
- Pathway enrichment via **KEGG** database.

- Sus scrofa (Pig)
- Macaca mulatta (Monkey)
- Bos taurus (Cattle)
- Canis lupus familiaris (Dog)
- Capra hircus (Goat)
- Oryctolagus cuniculus (Rabbit)

## ðŸ§ª Methods Summary

1. **Literature Search**: For selecting sequences, ligands, and active binding residues.
2. **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Conducted with ClustalW and visualized in iTOL.
3. **Structure Modeling**: Using homology modeling templates (e.g., PDB: 7EKT, 5KXI).
4. **Docking Studies**:
   - Protein-protein (nAChRsâ€“3FTX) via HADDOCK.
   - Protein-ligand (agonists/antagonists) via AutoDock4.
5. **Simulation & Analysis**:
   - RMSD, binding affinity, interaction residues.
   - 2D and 3D interaction diagrams via LigPlot+ and Discovery Studio.
6. **KEGG Pathways**: Functional relevance of receptor interactions.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- 3FTX toxins demonstrated **higher binding affinity** to Î±7 nAChRs compared to acetylcholine.
- Species-specific variations suggest evolutionary adaptations in receptor architecture.
- Certain non-toxin ligands showed strong binding potential, indicating therapeutic promise.
- KEGG pathway analysis supports the role of nAChRs in neurodegeneration, addiction, inflammation, and cognitive function.
